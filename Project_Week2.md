# The Week 2 Project: Urban Wall Marks Documentation Project - Besançon

Our project examined the unique limestone façades of Besançon’s historic city center, focusing on the city’s recurring bluish and cream-colored stone patterns. Motivated by the surprising variations left by quarrying and stone-cutting, we set out to document, analyze, and interpret these urban features.

Here is a description of our ['workflow'](Workflow.md).
