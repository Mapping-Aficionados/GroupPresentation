# The Week 2 Project

The final project was based on the observation that many buildings in the city are made of a local limestone that has distinct bluish and yellow/cream patterns. When quarried and cut into blocks, the different colors appear on the faces of the blocks that are visible from the street.

Each student in the class took some photos of patterns that interested them. We ended up with around one hundred photos. Each person examined the photo and jotted a note about what *they* thought the image resembled, a city-wide collection of [Rorschach-blots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rorschach_test).

## The Dataset

Our dataset is stored in the `/data/students_trajectories.csv` file. It captures the geographic origins and travel itineraries of each participant.

All locations are represented by latitude and longitude coordinates, making them ready for mapping.

# Urban Wall Markings Documentation Project - Besançon
# Summary of the group work and workflow (Thursday, 2-3:30pm)


## 1. Introduction  
- Urban exploration project documenting mysterious wall markings  
- Focused on Besançon's historic city center architecture  

## 2. Objectives  
- Catalog and analyze hidden visual language of walls  
- Interpret possible meanings behind surface patterns  

## 3. Data Collection  
- Photographed 100+ wall surfaces using smartphones  
- Precise geotagging of each discovery location  

## 4. Annotation Process  
- Independent pattern descriptions by each group member  
- Custom categories: "whale", "human visage", "animal", "symbolic"  

## 5. Interpretation Challenges  
- Frequent disagreements on ambiguous shapes  
- Difficulty distinguishing natural vs man-made formations  

## 6. Collaborative Analysis  
- Structured debates to compare interpretations  
- Identified both consensus patterns and outliers  

## 7. Data Organization  
- Comprehensive Google Sheet database  
- Linked geotagged photos with multiple interpretation columns  

## 8. Technical Processing  
- Batch compression of image files  
- Preserved critical visual details  

## 9. Publication  
- Complete collection hosted on GitHub  
- Publicly accessible for future research  

## 10. Team Experience  
- Energetic collaborative atmosphere  
- Intense discussions physically warmed workspace  

## 11. Key Findings  
- Recurring motif clusters discovered  
- Possible cultural/architectural significance  

## 12. Lessons Learned  
- Improved documentation methodologies  
- Better interpretation frameworks for ambiguous visuals  

## 13. Conclusion  
- First systematic documentation of Besançon's wall patterns  
- Successful collaborative analysis approach
