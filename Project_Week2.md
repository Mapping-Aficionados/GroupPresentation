# The Week 2 Project

The final project was based on the observation that many buildings in the city are made of a local limestone that has distinct bluish and yellow/cream patterns. When quarried and cut into blocks, the different colors appear on the faces of the blocks that are visible from the street.

Each student in the class took some photos of patterns that interested them. We ended up with around one hundred photos. Each person examined the photo and jotted a note about what *they* thought the image resembled, a city-wide collection of [Rorschach-blots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rorschach_test).

## The Dataset

Our dataset is stored in the `/data/students_trajectories.csv` file. It captures the geographic origins and travel itineraries of each participant.

All locations are represented by latitude and longitude coordinates, making them ready for mapping.
