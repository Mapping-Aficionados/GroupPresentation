# The Week 2 Project

The final project was based on the observation that many buildings in the city are made of a local limestone that has distinct bluish and yellow/cream patterns. When quarried and cut into blocks, the different colors appear on the faces of the blocks that are visible from the street.

Each student in the class took some photos of patterns that interested them. We ended up with around one hundred photos. Each person examined the photo and jotted a note about what *they* thought the image resembled, a city-wide collection of [Rorschach-blots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rorschach_test).

## The Dataset

Our dataset is stored in the `/data/students_trajectories.csv` file. It captures the geographic origins and travel itineraries of each participant.

All locations are represented by latitude and longitude coordinates, making them ready for mapping.

# Urban Wall Marks Documentation Project - Besançon  
## Summary of the group work and workflow (Thursday, 2-3:30pm)  

## 1. Introduction  
Our team investigated mysterious patterns on urban walls throughout Besançon. The project focused on architectural surfaces in the historic city center.  

## 2. Objectives  
We aimed to systematically catalog wall markings citywide. Secondary goals included analyzing patterns and interpreting their potential hidden meanings.  

## 3. Data Collection  
Using smartphone cameras, we captured 100+ wall surfaces. Each photo was precisely geotagged to map discovery locations accurately.  

## 4. Annotation Process  
Team members independently described observed patterns. We created custom categories including whale shapes, faces, animals, and symbolic forms.  

## 5. Interpretation Challenges  
Disagreements arose when shapes appeared ambiguous. Distinguishing natural erosion from intentional markings proved particularly difficult at many sites.  

## 6. Collaborative Analysis  
Through structured discussions, we compared individual interpretations. This process revealed both consensus patterns and interesting outlier observations.  

## 7. Data Organization  
All findings were compiled in Google Sheets. The database linked geotagged photos with multiple interpretation columns for cross-analysis.  

## 8. Technical Processing  
Image files underwent batch compression for storage efficiency. Care was taken to preserve all visually significant pattern details.  

## 9. Publication  
The complete annotated collection was uploaded to GitHub. This public repository enables ongoing access for future researchers.  

## 10. Team Experience  
Collaboration created an exceptionally energetic working environment. Our intense brainstorming sessions noticeably raised the room's temperature.  

## 11. Key Findings  
We identified several recurring motif clusters. These patterns may hold cultural or architectural significance worth further investigation.  

## 12. Lessons Learned  
We developed improved documentation techniques. New frameworks emerged for interpreting ambiguous urban visual phenomena effectively.  

## 13. Conclusion  
This project created Besançon's first systematic wall pattern record. Our collaborative approach proved highly successful for urban analysis.
