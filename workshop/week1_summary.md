# Our First Week: A Journey from Data to Digital Map

This week, we dove into the world of **Humanities Data and Mapping Environments**. Our journey took us from the foundational theories of the spatial humanities to the practical application of building and publishing our own web maps. We learned not just *how* to make a map, but *why* we make them and *how* they can tell powerful stories.

### What We Accomplished:

*   **Laying the Foundation (Theory & Concepts):**
    *   We started by exploring the core concepts of the **spatial humanities**, critically examining existing projects to understand their methods and narrative strategies.
    *   We learned how to **model data for humanities research**, thinking about how to capture the spatial dimensions of literature, history, and art in a simple spreadsheet.

*   **From Text to Data Points (Data Creation):**
    *   Using **Recogito**, we practiced semantic annotation, extracting and geolocating place names from historical texts to create our own structured datasets.

*   **Bringing Data to Life (Visualization):**
    *   We visualized our data using powerful, web-based tools like **Kepler.gl** and **Palladio**, learning to create point-to-point maps that reveal connections and patterns.
    *   We moved to the professional, open-source desktop software **QGIS**, where we learned to create high-quality maps for publication and export them for the web.

*   **Sharing Our Work with the World (Dissemination):**
    *   We gained fundamental skills in using **GitHub**, from version control with GitHub Desktop to authoring content in Markdown.
    *   Crucially, we learned how to host our interactive maps and projects online using **GitHub Pages**, making our work accessible and shareable.

*   **Real-World Application & Future Horizons:**
    *   We put our skills to the test by working with real-world data: mapping our own GPS-tagged photos and exploring open data from the city of Besançon.
    *   Our visit to the **Bibliothèque d’étude et de conservation** connected our digital work to the physical archives that inspire it.
    *   Finally, we looked to the future by exploring how **AI coding assistants** can help us modify and enhance our web maps, contrasting manual creation with automated analysis.

In one week, we've gone from brainstorming ideas to creating and publishing live, interactive spatial stories.
