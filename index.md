# The Journey to Besançon: A Spatial Narrative of ESU workshop participants trajectories

Welcome to the `mapping_aficionados` project for the **"Humanities Data and Mapping Environments"** workshop at ESU 2025!

This project visualizes the collective journey of our workshop participants from around the globe to our meeting point in Besançon, France. Using Kepler.gl, we transform a simple dataset of departure points and travel stops into a rich spatial narrative, telling the story of how our academic community comes together.

## The Week 1 Project

Our initial project mapped our travels to Besancon. There are several different visualizations that can be seen [here](Project_Week1.md)

## The Week 2 Project

The larger project is a collection of our photographs of interesting images we saw on the rock walls of the buildings in the city. There is a [page](Project_Week2.md) describing the project and what *we* saw on the walls. You will doubtless see other things.


# What we've been doing so far in the course? 

We have prepared a [brief summary](workshop/week1_summary.md) of it!
