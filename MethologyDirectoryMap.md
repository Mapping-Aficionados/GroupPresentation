# Methology for Directory Map

This map was created by:

1. Taking a photograph of a Besancon directory from ca. 1907.
1. Doing OCR on the photograph
1. Processing the OCR to create columlar data, with the householder's name, occupation, and address.
1. A geolocation service processed the addresses and produced lat/lon data for each address.
1. The resulting CSV file was visualized using [kepler.gl](https://kepler.gl/), which creates an HTML file.
